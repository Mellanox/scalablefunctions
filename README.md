# scalablefunctions

Scalable function is a lightweight function that has a parent PCI function on which it is deployed.

Scalable functions are useful for containers where netdevice and rdma device of scalable function can be assign to a container.
This way container can get complete offload capabilities of eswitch, isolation and dedicated accelerated network device.

This is a complete user guide on how to use scalable functions in a Linux system.
It talks about all nuts and bolts of device, firmware support, kernel knobs, user commands and examples.
